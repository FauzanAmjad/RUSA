This repository is to crunch the statistics of the Rutgers University Student Assembly (RUSA) Recovery Fund. The dataset is NOT provided as it contains private information and cannot be accessed publicly. However, the R notebook developed is publicly accessible as well as the analyses derived from it. A report on the RUSA Recovery Fund will be provided to the student body upon completion.
